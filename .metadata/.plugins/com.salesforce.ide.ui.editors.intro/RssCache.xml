<p>First up, we have a <a href="http://www.developerforce.com/events/boston_developer_meetup/registration.php?d=70130000000G865" target="_blank">Developer Meetup the evening of July 13th</a>, in Waltham. As usual, we break these evenings up in to two tracks: one focused on new Force.com developers, and another track targetted at more advanced developers, where we discuss a topic of current interest to the community. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kuntalvahalia" target="_blank">Kuntal Vahalia</a>, one of my favorite Salesforce collegues, a wicked, smart guy (see how I used the local Boston, lingo? Yep, I'm down with it), and uber knowledgable on integration, will be presenting track one. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/quintonwall" target="_blank">Yours truly</a> will be presenting track two, which will be all things mobile (I have some fun surprises in store too...you will have to <a href="http://www.developerforce.com/events/boston_developer_meetup/registration.php?d=70130000000G865" target="_blank">register</a> to find out what they are!!)</p>
<p><br><a href="http://blog.sforce.com/.a/6a00d8341cded353ef01543385e29c970c-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Cannoli" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341cded353ef01543385e29c970c" src="http://blog.sforce.com/.a/6a00d8341cded353ef01543385e29c970c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Cannoli"></img></a> If a night of code, carbohydrates, and conversation is not enough, Kuntal and I will be presenting a day long Developer Workshop on July 14th. Talk to your local Account Exec about registering to attend this event (last I heard the event was 'sold out', if a free event can be sold out? The more people who express interest however, will make it easier for us to come back to Boston again soon!) The Developer Workshops are a deep dive into all aspects of the platform, and a great way to get some hands on experience, talk to other companies to see what they are doing in the Cloud, and meet some new peeps who might be going to Dreamforce. Remeber, as a developer, we encourage you to save money for your <a href="http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/" target="_blank">next gadget</a>, by using the <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF11/developers/developer-discount/" target="_blank">Dreamforce Developer discount!</a></p>
<p>See you next week in Boston! I'll be the one going back for seconds at <a href="http://www.finaledesserts.com/" target="_blank">Finale</a>, and attempting to stuff my suitcase full of Canolis from <a href="http://www.mikespastry.com/" target="_blank">Mike's Pastry</a>.

These APIs allow you to integrate/mashup/enhance/mobilize applications built on the Force.com platform and the best part is that the Force.com API suite is like the US Federal debt - its constantly growing! Recently, we've added a <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/chatterapi/index.htm" target="_blank">Chatter REST API</a> (excellent webinar recording available <a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Webinar:Chatter_REST_API" target="_blank">here</a>), a Streaming API (make sure to register for the webinar on 7/7 <a href="http://www.developerforce.com/events/streaming_api_webinar/registration.php?d=70130000000G6y0" target="_blank">here</a>) and an Apex REST API. </p>
<p><a href="http://developer.force.com/releases/release/Summer11/Apex+REST" target="_blank">Apex REST</a> is a new Pilot feature in Summer 11, and we demoed it in the <a href="http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Webinar:_Summer_11_release_preview" target="_blank">Summer 11 preview webinar</a> that Dave Carroll and I did a couple of months back. The feature is important enough though to deserve its own turn in the spotlight and so Alex Toussaint (Product Manager for the API) and I will be hosting a webinar on 7/19 to review this new feature. Apex REST gives you the ability to expose any custom Apex code as a RESTful service that external clients (such as mobile devices) can invoke and consume. In other words, you can develop your own custom REST API using Apex and the full power of the Force.com platform. You can find some additional details about this feature in <a href="http://blog.sforce.com/sforce/2011/05/apex-rest-services-in-summer-11.html" target="_blank">this blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a small snippet from that blog entry to give you an idea of what an Apex REST class might look like:</p>
<pre class="brush: VisualForce">@RestResource(urlMapping='/CaseManagement/*')
global with sharing class CaseManagementRESTSvc {

    @HttpGet
    global static Case getCaseRecord(RestRequest req, RestResponse res) {
        String caseNum = req.requestURI.substring(req.requestURI.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
        Case c = CustomCaseMgmt.getCase(caseNum);
        return c;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>As you can see, using some special new Apex annotations (@RestResource, @HttpGet etc.), you can expose custom Apex logic to clients that prefer to use the more lightweight REST/JSON protocols (instead of the SOAP/XML formats that is supported by another somewhat similar Force.com feature - <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/apexcode/Content/apex_web_services.htm" target="_blank">Apex SOAP services</a>). </p>
<p>Please join us on 7/19 <a href="http://www.developerforce.com/events/apex_rest_api_webinar/registration.php?d=70130000000G5wr" target="_blank">by registering</a> for either the 7am PDT or 10am PDT slot and find out more about the use cases, code samples and best practices for using Apex REST. Hope to see you then.</p></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/forceblogside/~4/a4z355K2Awk" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><description>In my humble (and admittedly somewhat biased) opinion, one of the biggest strengths of the Force.com platform is its suite of APIs.

<p><a href="www.servicemax.com" target="_self">ServiceMax</a> offers a complete cloud-based, collaborative, and mobile solution for field service management. <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/company/news-press/press-releases/2008/11/081103-1.jsp" target="_self">Winner of the Force.com Million Dollar Challenge in 2008</a>, the company built a successful service chain management and field service support business from the ground up on Force.com. <a href="http://www.servicemax.com/about-us/management-team.html" target="_self">Stacey Epstein</a> is Vice President of Marketing.</p>
<p><strong>What is field service management?</strong></p>
<p>Field service management optimizes the process of delivering service to a customer’s site in the field. All the white service vans you see on the road are probably on the way to a company or residence to install, upgrade, or fix something. We’re hard at work behind the scenes making that happen. Our solutions help automate scheduling and dispatch, contracts, entitlements, and parts logistics.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you choose to build your business on Force.com?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.salesforce.com/platform/" target="_self">Force.com</a> is the backbone of our business from a technology, sales and marketing, and services standpoint. Everything we do runs alongside or on top of the platform. From the very beginning we built our product on Force.com, and from there we’ve extended it using tools from Salesforce.com and the developer community. The <a href="www.appexchange.com" target="_self">AppExchange</a> and <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/platform/isvforce/" target="_self">ISVforce</a> are prominent in our go-to-market strategy, and we work with salesforce.com in every way as we run our business.</p>
<p><strong>What are your favorite Force.com technologies?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.salesforce.com/chatter/whatischatter/" target="_self">Chatter</a> was a natural fit for our app and we implemented it fully, customizing it for field service. We also love all the innovations in mobile, especially the ability to quickly develop iPad apps with <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/platform/database/" target="_self">Database.com</a>. <a href="http://www.servicemax.com/products/servicemax-for-ipad.html" target="_self">ServiceMax for iPad</a> is the first and only iPad app for complete field service management, and we built it in just 2 weeks. The app, which <a href="http://thesmartvan.com/servicemax/2011/05/10/servicemax-for-ipad-wins-tsia-vision-award-american-idol-of-the-service-industry/" target="_self">won the prestigious TSIA Vision Award</a>, embodies what we’re all about as a company: putting meaningful, intuitive technologies in the hands of field service technicians so they can be smarter and more productive. Force.com has helped get us to the cutting edge of our market<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s next for ServiceMax?</strong></p>
<p>We recently announced a <a href="http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/playing-field-servicemax-raises-14m-series-c-round-funding-reports-nearly-400-percent-1524383.htm" target="_self">$14 million round of Series C funding led by Mayfield Fund</a>, a top-tier venture firm with a 42-year history of investing in relationships. This latest round of funding comes on the heels of continued company growth and customer wins, with more than 380 percent year-over-year growth in first quarter of 2011. We’ve also added of dozens of new customers, including three Fortune 25 manufacturers and six other Fortune 500 customers.</p>
<p>In an industry long devoid of 21<sup>st</sup> century technology, we’re showing service firms around the world that there’s a better way than the pens and pads of paper they’re used to. We plan to continue to lead the field service market with new products that are innovative, mobile, and social.</p></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/forceblogside/~4/2vFI5IHErGo" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded><description>ServiceMax offers a complete cloud-based, collaborative, and mobile solution for field service management.

<ul>
<li>On Monday, July 4, at the "Cloud 2011 Summer School", I'll be presenting the "Cloud Development and Deployment" tutorial. Designed for developers by developers, this workshop mixes presentations with hands-on coding exercises that teach you how to build a cloud app using the world’s premier cloud platform, <a title="Force.com" href="http://www.salesforce.com/platform/" target="_self">Force.com</a>. This tutorial will provide you with a deeper understand of cloud computing and help you build a fully functional cloud app that you can extend on your own. Three full hours of hands-on training, workbook included!</li>
<li>On Wednesday, July 6, I'm presenting my paper, "Optimal Multitenant Designs for Cloud Apps." Often overlooked by application architects, multitenancy is the core technology of a cloud that controls how it shares computing resources among applications. Two basic approaches for multitenancy will be discussed, virtual and organic multitenancy, along with the benefits and disadvantages of each approach. Then you will discover why the database that supports a cloud app is a critical consideration, and learn about emerging cloud database options that promise to simplify the development and management of apps executing in the cloud. Along the way, we'll draw conclusions about which types of solutions best fit particular application scenarios.</li>

The conversation started by espousing the virtues of re-use in software engineering when compared to other engineering disciples such as mechanical engineering. I am going to come out and say it: <strong>re-use is over-rated in software engineering.</strong></p>
<p>Before I get flamed for loosing my mind, let me explain by posing a question: <strong>What is more important: re-use or time to market?</strong></p>
<p>Let's think about this statement for a moment. Sure, I admit, re-use may help us reduce time to market at times, especially if I am re-using someone elses' work (eg: an open source library I don't maintain, and was developed by a subject matter expert - In this case, re-use rocks!). </p>
<p><strong>But does time to market imply re-use?</strong> No, and often it is counter productive. </p>
<p>I can't remember how many times in the past I spent additional hours making something more generic and 're-usable' only to find that by the time I needed to re-use it again, technology had evolved enough that there was a better, easier, simpler and smarter way to do the same thing. My theory is that re-use evolved into the holy grail in software engineering because things just became so hard to write the first time (can anyone spell E-J-Bs?). </p>
<p><br> <a href="http://blog.sforce.com/.a/6a00d8341cded353ef014e89801f80970d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Refactor" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341cded353ef014e89801f80970d" src="http://blog.sforce.com/.a/6a00d8341cded353ef014e89801f80970d-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Refactor"></img></a> So what's the solution? If you ask me, it is composable applications which are based on good design practices which allow you to swap libraries, change protocols, deploy your app somewhere different, or just plain start again and build it quicker and more efficiently than you could before. <strong>Refactoring of solutions</strong> should be a core principle, not an after thought. I am still amazed refactoring it is not a subject in itself in CS courses.</p>
<p>As Albert Einstein said, "<em>Out of clutter, find simplicity.</em>"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This notion of ease of use is one of the things which attracted me to the Cloud, and in particular, Force.com and Heroku (and Ruby/Rails). I can't remember how many times I have torn down a schema I created in Force.com when a new requirement would be solved quicker with a new design, or by pushing a Rails app to Heroku without spending hours tweaking a web server config to support HTTPS. Or I want to improve app performance with a Memcache Add-on. Or spinning up some new dynos.... The list goes on!</p>
<p>In summary, yes re-use is important, but before you spend cycles coding a 'maybe' scenario, ask yourself if doing so will improve time to market. This reflection may help you identify open source libraries you could use instead, design patterns which will help you refactor in the future, and cloud services which change the way you build apps.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>You'll notice that I've added a couple of links to <a href="https://github.com/ForceDotComLabs" target="_self">Github repos</a>. Almost all Force.com Labs apps are open source.  If you have a change you would like to make, please jump right in.  We value your contributions!</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.sforce.com/.a/6a00d8341cded353ef01538f87bbb2970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Picture 5" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341cded353ef01538f87bbb2970b image-full" src="http://blog.sforce.com/.a/6a00d8341cded353ef01538f87bbb2970b-800wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 5"></img></a> <br><br></p>
<p>OK now let's take a look at the new apps.</p>
<p><a href="http://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000004fqdKEAQ" target="_self">The Chatter Game</a> - Wondering how to boost Chatter adoption in your org?  Why not make it a game. The Chatter Game aims to help.  It helps you reward target behavior with points and includes a handy leader board so people can check their ranking.  The Chatter Game is from Chris Kemp, the rock star behind <a href="http://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000003GGRwEAO" target="_self">Cloud Swarm</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.sforce.com/.a/6a00d8341cded353ef01538f879363970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Picture 3" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341cded353ef01538f879363970b" src="http://blog.sforce.com/.a/6a00d8341cded353ef01538f879363970b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 3"></img></a> <br><br></p>
<p>This app is actually interesting on multiple levels.  First and foremost, it can be a valuable training tool for the segment of your users who respond to this kind of thing.  Leader boards can be surprisingly powerful motivators for people who might not pay close attention to things like PowerPoint presentations, conference calls, pre-recorded trainings, etc.</p>
<p>Second, it also provides an interesting model for other point based reward system.  One possibility called out at the KCUG (by akaCRM's <a href="https://dreamevent.my.salesforce.com/_ui/core/userprofile/UserProfilePage?u=00530000003zHxh" target="_self">Brian Connell</a>***) is to create a similar system that rewards proper data entry on core Sales Cloud / Service Cloud objects.  THIS IS A GREAT IDEA.  The good news is that The Chatter Game is unmanaged and open source.  Someone needs to take that idea and run with it.</p>
<p><a href="http://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000004g316EAA" target="_self">salesforce.com CRM Dashboards</a> - What app do I predict will be #1 this time next month?  This one. These dashboards include something for everyone and work with PE and up.  Sales &amp; Marketing Dashboards include reports and dashboards for Marketing Executives, Sales Executives, Sales Managers and Salespeople.  The Customer Service Dashboards include offerings for Agent Supervisors and Service Executives and a great Service KPI Dashboard.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.sforce.com/.a/6a00d8341cded353ef014e897ae2ad970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Picture 2" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341cded353ef014e897ae2ad970d" src="http://blog.sforce.com/.a/6a00d8341cded353ef014e897ae2ad970d-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Picture 2"></img></a> <br><br></p>
<p>Be sure to check out the excellent <a href="http://appexchange.salesforce.com/content?contentId=a0K30000002so1tEAA" target="_self">help document</a> that comes with the app.</p>
<p><a href="http://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N30000004g33vEAA" target="_self">Mass Lead Converter</a> - Last but not least is Mass Lead Converter, a way to convert multiple leads at the same time.  When you install it, you get a button for your Lead List Views.  Check the Leads you want to convert, click the button, and you can then start the conversion.  You can create a new Account or use an existing one; create zero, one or many opportunities; and create a single task or a task for each lead converted.</p>

<p>To get Node.js up and running, I wouldn't go any farther than fellow evangelist James Ward's <a href="http://www.jamesward.com/2011/06/21/getting-started-with-node-js-on-the-cloud/" target="_self">Getting Started with Node.js</a> article.  It's easily one of the most complete, starting from a blank slate where one hasn't tried git or Heroku before and takes you to creating a simple Hello World application using the popular Node module <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_self">express</a>.</p>
<p>I've started putting together a sample application which access our OAuth login and REST endpoints (similar in functionality to the <a href="https://github.com/developerforce/Flex-RESTkit" target="_self">Flex REST project</a>).  The most stable version will be updated over at our developerforce github account, under the rather unmarketable title of <a href="https://github.com/developerforce/FDC-NODEJS-HEROKU" target="_self">FDC-NODEJS-HEROKU</a>.  It might need a rebranding as "Black Falcon" or the like in the future, but at least there's little question about what resides there at the moment.</p>
<p>This project includes support for the new Apex REST endpoints, and is a great way to test out the new functionality. The demo project currently uses the Node.js server as a proxy for sending out AJAX calls using jQuery, so creating this callout</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.sforce.com/.a/6a00d8341cded353ef014e8974fd86970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Screen shot 2011-06-28 at 4.53.34 PM" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d8341cded353ef014e8974fd86970d image-full" src="http://blog.sforce.com/.a/6a00d8341cded353ef014e8974fd86970d-800wi" title="Screen shot 2011-06-28 at 4.53.34 PM"></img></a> </p>
<p>on the web page will be converted into a call to a custom endpoint "FieldCase" which has been defined completely using <a href="http://blog.sforce.com/sforce/2011/05/apex-rest-services-in-summer-11.html" target="_self">Apex REST</a>. Using this call, all we need is a company name and a case type, and the code will create the correct case with the correct support persons and documentation.  You can also call the rest module directly, if you want to blend these callouts with existing Node.js projects.</p>
<p>Apex REST is currently in pilot, so you'll need to contact Salesforce support - or as usual, send a tweet to <a href="http://twitter.com/joshbirk" target="_self">@joshbirk</a> and I'll see if I can get things enabled. <strong>Update: </strong>Pilot for dev orgs will be after the webinar mentioned below, so can't get it enabled until then.</p>
<p>Honestly, there's too much to cover in just this blog post.  In fact, we have a whole webinar coming up just on Apex REST itself on July 19th, so <a href="http://www.developerforce.com/events/apex_rest_api_webinar/registration.php?d=70130000000G5wr" target="_self">register now</a> and bask in the Summer of API's.  I'll have more on Node.js, REST and this project later as well.</p>
<p>Naturally, if you want to get the latest and greatest information on developing with Heroku and Force.com - head on over to <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF11/" target="_self">Dreamforce</a>, where you can meet with us face to face to learn cutting edge techniques with the platform.</p>
